Okay, not happy with this one at all.

Part one: failed at the first attempt on the test data, but out
of exasperation entered the input data result into the AoC page
and it was correct. Later on I did debug one step which got the
proper result on both data sets.

Part two: my original idea was to run the Dijkstra backwards,
from ‘E’ to the first ‘a’. This produced a correct result on the
test data, but the input data result was too high. Next, I tried
scanning for all the ‘a’ starting points; but got lots of heapq
IndexError. It took me a while to realise that the input data has
a number of valleys with walls too steep to climb out of, so
I put in a break for those. Finally, I could not get an answer
lower than the first one I did. After consulting the solutions
megathread on Reddit, one possible solution in Python produced
the same wrong answer as mine. The second one did result in
a lower, correct, result, but I find it hard to see what it is
doing that my attempt missed. 

In short, lots of anguish, but I am not sure that I have really
learned anything.
