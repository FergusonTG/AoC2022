At last one I could solve with basic Python skills!

I considered parsing the lines element by element, but when the
````eval```` function is available, why not use it with such
tightly controlled input?

Comparing had to be done element by element because I could not
work out any way of using ```try â€¦ except``` to intercept
comparisons between int and list.

Finally I had to look up how to use ```functools.cmp_to_key```
and I would love to know how it works!
